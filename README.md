> **Roadmap**

Here is the short term roadmap with an overview of the features currently being worked on:

**Explorer statistics** - *in progress*

* Create snapshots of network data every hour and display the results in various charts
– Transactions - sent/received/type/value/token
– ZNN - Sent/received/mint/burn/staked/delegated/locked in pillar & sentinels
– QSR - Sent/received/mint/burn/fused/locked in sentinel
– Addresses - Active per snapshot/total active/new
– Supply - total/available ZNN & QSR

**User accounts upgrades** - *planning*

* Create address/token watchlists
* Custom address labels
* Private notes on tx/momentums/addresses/tokens

**Communities** - *planning*

* Each address gets a social media style feed, addresses can post and others can comment/like/dislike/vote
* Groups of addresses allow users to build communities e.g pillar delegator community

> **Future ideas**

These are some ideas being considered but havent been worked into the roadmap yet:

* Login with syrius browser extension - depends on a [update](https://github.com/DexterLabZ/syrius-extension/issues/20) to the extension
* Explorer discord bot
* API for indexed data
* Webhooks for on chain activity

> **Funding**

**Total Requested Funding**
5,000 ZNN
50,000 QSR

If accepted I would be applying for the full amount in one go with the intention of spawning a sentinel to help cover the ongoing development and server costs.
